    "In this chat, you provided a Monty Hall simulation code and asked for an explanation. I broke down the logic of the original code, explaining key steps such as choosing a prize door, revealing a goat door, and switching doors. You also asked about the function of .append() and how the code behaves when the player's initial choice is the winning door.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, you requested a simpler, more readable version of the code. I refactored it for clarity by adding comments, using descriptive variable names, and streamlining the logic. You then asked for the code to be structured using loops and if-else statements instead of list comprehensions, which I provided to match your preference for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I gave a revised version of the code, removing list comprehensions and replacing them with explicit loops and conditionals.\n",

    "ChatGPT was able to very quickly help me understand the codes, it was able to break the code down to 1 to 2 lines sections and go through them one by one, giving reason and details about the function, variable and structure used in the codes. It also provided simple exmaples of what the code does and usually ends the explaintion with a summary of some sort. And with further instructions, ChatGPT was able narrow to just a single function or line and provide very insightful explainations. \n",

    "Initially after looking through the course webpage, I was both skeptical and worried about the course's rely on AI/Chatbots, since I never really used it to do anything serious and most other courses I have taken/taking right now discourge the use of AI to do the work for us. But after using it for these few weeks, I found the use of AI/Chatbot very helpful in terms of getting answers for very specific question. I was able to use ChatGpt to learn to code and apply it in terms of data science. The use of AI has taken a lot of \"work\" out of statistics since the goal is not to code but to analyse the data. I believe with the recent development of AI, coding, statistics and data science are more accessible than ever. "
